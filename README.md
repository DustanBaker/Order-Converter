# Order-Converter
Tool for converting CSV files

This program was developed by Dusty Baker 2024
The program is written in python using the tkinter and customtkinter GUI libraries.
The program inports a CSV file that is given as an order request with a "Kit ID" and converts the "Kit ID' to a SKU based order upload into a WMS.
This version is version 1.1 that has been updated to support the new "Sales order template" needed to upload into the WMS 4/30/2024
This program has error handling by only accepting pre-defined codes.

Future improvements include more OOP, adding additional clients other than USCG, creating a return ASN for specific Kit IDs, including a splash screen, including a progress bar for longer conversions, and Predefining a location to save the file so that uploads can be executed without saving a file twice.
