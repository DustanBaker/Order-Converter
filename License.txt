The use of the "Eagle File Manger" application signifies your agreement to these terms. If you actually read this far then congratulations on being a true friend. Also this Application Comes with a subscription fee of 2 "Glizzies" per month per user. Additional Payments can also be made in the form of memes that can be added to the application. The fact that B511 has been added is purely to help David in his monumental task of keeping operations (Specifically Shanon and Tony) in line. Should Angel also install this application he probably wont read this. A special thanks to my confidential informant for pointing me to the right location in the server to store the data and dank memes. (thanks Aaron)
